<p>Unique gleaming spiral handles set off the curvaceous doors to satisfy 
	the design conscious. A versatile cooktop and flexible electric ovens indulge those with the highest culinary standards. Optional cathedral doors 
	are available in all colors. With this bold appearance and contemporary features, it's easy to see why this AGA out looks and out cooks other 
	pro-style ranges.</p>
<h4>7-Mode Multifunction Oven</h4>
<p>Offers ultimate flexibility with 7 different cooking modes. Turn the convection off, leave it on or go somewhere in between-you tailor the oven's
	performance to your needs by selecting from the convection bake, convection broil, fan assist bake, conventional bake, top brown or base heat modes.</p>
