	internal ice cube maker, and water for ice is filtered by the internal water filtering system, so you can enjoy the purest ice possible. 
	An extra-large deli drawer has plenty of space for all your meats and cheeses, and large humidity-controlled crisper drawers keep fruits and 
	vegetables fresh and ready to eat.</p>
