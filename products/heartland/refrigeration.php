<p>Our 36" wide ENERGY STAR French door refrigerator is the perfect match for your Heartland range or woodburning cookstove. Electronic 
	touch controls and a built-in filtered water dispenser are just a few of the convenience features. The 5.4 cu. ft. capacity freezer contains an 
	internal ice cube maker, and water for ice is filtered by the internal water filtering system, so you can enjoy the purest ice possible. 
	An extra-large deli drawer has plenty of space for all your meats and cheeses, and large humidity-controlled crisper drawers keep fruits and 
	vegetables fresh and ready to eat.</p>

<h4>Classic Door</h4>
<p>Heartland Classic Refrigeration is all about flexibility, freshness, and styling. Our four-sided adjustable door bins are sturdy enough to lift out even
	 when fully loaded, and the laddered system allows you to adjust the bins to fit your storage needs. Humidity controlled crisper bins provide 
	 flexible storage and preservation for your fruits and vegetables, and are clear for easy viewing. A seal at the front of the crisper locks in humidity 
	 to keep leafy vegetables crisp and fresh, and controls are easy to read and can be quickly adjusted to set the desired crisper temperature. The pull-out
	 freezer features upper and lower baskets with tons of capacity. And all this comes with Classic craftsmanship, nostalgic styling, and rich color options. </p>
