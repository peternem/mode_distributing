<p> Our four-sided adjustable door bins are sturdy enough to lift out even
	 when fully loaded, and the laddered system allows you to adjust the bins to fit your storage needs. Humidity controlled crisper bins provide 
	 flexible storage and preservation for your fruits and vegetables, and are clear for easy viewing. A seal at the front of the crisper locks in humidity 
	 to keep leafy vegetables crisp and fresh, and controls are easy to read and can be quickly adjusted to set the desired crisper temperature. The pull-out
	 freezer features upper and lower baskets with tons of capacity. And all this comes with Classic craftsmanship, nostalgic styling, and rich color options. </p>
